A solid keyboard for the price,4 stars,5.46,neutral,0.5983901023864746
A fairly inexpensive 60 keyboard with clicky mechanical switches Its satisfying to type on and has an impressive set of modern features for the price The keyboard is powered via USBC has a nice singlecolor LED backlight with multiple settings comes with some extra key caps and is weighted nicely I am not a keyboard enthusiast and would definitely not recommend this for people wanting a platform to buildmodify For most casuals this is a fine keyboardNegatives are as follows The LED is dim even at its brightest If you do not use Windows some of the function keys may not work Finally the key travel seems long but this would only affect those who are new to using mechanical keyboards,3 stars,5.13,neutral,0.8288679122924805
Pretty good,4 stars,6.32,joy,0.8565828204154968
This isnt a you get what you pay for situation In fact you get a lot more than youd expect I got the blue switches and they are appropriately clicky Its a cool little keyboard and one that I would recommend if youre on the fence about mechanical keyboards or even if youre a collector and want something a little different and cheaper than the competitors out there The backlight is a nice feature and it has 15 different lighting settings The lack of a num pad isnt ideal but for a small form factor compact keyboard I would recommend it,3 stars,4.83,neutral,0.9266455173492432

So there is plenty good and plenty bad about this keyboard For 25 the price I paid was 23 and change plus tax its hard to do much better than this A few notes about things I saw in other reviews that were not true for the two units I received switches are labeled ZDZ Ive not been able to find much about these They appear to be a knockoff of Outemu which themselves are generally considered the bottomofthebarrel in terms of pricequality units are NOT RGB They do have backlighting but its just blue not red or green or any combination of other colors Also its more of a cyanblue so NOT primary blue like would be present in an RGB LED lighting sourceCons units are very lightweight and chattery sounding units seem to have some compatibility issues  they worked with my KVM but not my dock switch stems have a weird protrusion on some of the wings that makes keycap replacement rather difficult and feels like it could damage other switch components due to the forces required labeling The boxes they came in did not denote switch types at least not in English and some of the keys that can only be actuated via an Fn combination are not marked anywhere on the keyboardPros units are as described by manufacturer They did not claim any specific switch brand or RGB lighting functionality These should be able to provide every individual keypress and combination reasonably needed in most contexts for WindowsMacLinux users adjustable feet with rubber All 3 levels of rear feet  flat medium and tall  have rubberized patches where they contact the tabledesk surface This is a feature many more expensive keyboards are somehow lacking and was shocked to find it at this price point USBC It may not be fully compliant I do not have the ability to test for that but the fact that its using a USBC connector on the keyboard rather than something obsolete is nice to see especially at this price point,2 stars,4.49,surprise,0.905951976776123

This tkeyboard is great Good solid key feel and response The LED backlight is fine It is dimmable and will run a few patterns Good solid hookup cable It comes with a key puller and both RED and GRAY keys I liked the Gray but nice option to include No problems Good Buy,5 stars,5.4,neutral,0.7475839853286743

Good budget keyboard with a few modifications,4 stars,7.29,neutral,0.9173250198364258
Keyboard sounds hollow and cheap out of the box  Throw some foam in the bottom of it and tape the back of the PCB with painters tape and you have a keyboard that feels and sounds better than any razer keyboard out there  I broke a NuPhy air 75 and a Razer black widow v3 just this year by dropping it off my recliner chair  So I bought this one  At least when this one breaks  Im only out 30 dollars instead of 150  But to be honest  This keyboard with the lights mods I did to it is the best keyboard Iv ever used  Big fan  I recommend it All the other keyboards are from China  So why not get the cheaper one that admits it up front,2 stars,2.61,sadness,0.6073119044303894
Not wireless,1 star,5.03,neutral,0.8637869954109192
While searching for a wireless keyboard this cant up as a top result It is an excellent keyboard with a great feel but its definitely not wireless I blame Amazon and their crappy search box Adding more detail to a search makes the results more vague the manufacturer never claimed it was wirelessAnyway good keyboard with long keystrokes and excellent feel like an old IBM Selectric typewriter It has just the right amount of weight to it as wellIt is loud sounds like a keyboard from a movie I cant type full speed in class I have to type gentlyThere are some extra keys that come with it with in different colors as well as a tool for pulling them off They must be for gaming I dont game on PC I just wanted a good fast keyboard for CAD The keys do light up in ONE color that cannot be changed however brightness is easily adjusted after reading the 110 pages manual to find the right function key The keys are individually lit and backlit like a glow between them as well as the face There are several different moving patterns of lighting as well I keep it medium lot and solid Im boringI like it a lot Would love it long time if it were wireless,3 stars,4.79,neutral,0.7705512642860413
