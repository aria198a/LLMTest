A solid keyboard for the price,4 stars,5.46,neutral,0.5983901023864746
A fairly inexpensive 60 keyboard with clicky mechanical switches Its satisfying to type on and has an impressive set of modern features for the price The keyboard is powered via USBC has a nice singlecolor LED backlight with multiple settings comes with some extra key caps and is weighted nicely I am not a keyboard enthusiast and would definitely not recommend this for people wanting a platform to buildmodify For most casuals this is a fine keyboardNegatives are as follows The LED is dim even at its brightest If you do not use Windows some of the function keys may not work Finally the key travel seems long but this would only affect those who are new to using mechanical keyboards,3 stars,5.13,neutral,0.8288679122924805
Pretty good,4 stars,6.32,joy,0.8565828204154968
This isnt a you get what you pay for situation In fact you get a lot more than youd expect I got the blue switches and they are appropriately clicky Its a cool little keyboard and one that I would recommend if youre on the fence about mechanical keyboards or even if youre a collector and want something a little different and cheaper than the competitors out there The backlight is a nice feature and it has 15 different lighting settings The lack of a num pad isnt ideal but for a small form factor compact keyboard I would recommend it,3 stars,4.83,neutral,0.9266455173492432
good and cheap,4 stars,4.02,neutral,0.6032869219779968
exactly what i was hoping for a nice clicky and responsive keyboard for cheapi did notice that the included optional red key caps were not all compatible including keys which are the wrong shape for this keyboard and an enter key which is the wrong height I wasnt planning on changing them anyway so it doesnt cause me any concern but if you are planning on using the included alternate key caps I would advise caution,4 stars,6.11,fear,0.9170161485671997

This tkeyboard is great Good solid key feel and response The LED backlight is fine It is dimmable and will run a few patterns Good solid hookup cable It comes with a key puller and both RED and GRAY keys I liked the Gray but nice option to include No problems Good Buy,5 stars,5.4,neutral,0.7475839853286743

Good budget keyboard with a few modifications,4 stars,7.29,neutral,0.9173250198364258
Keyboard sounds hollow and cheap out of the box  Throw some foam in the bottom of it and tape the back of the PCB with painters tape and you have a keyboard that feels and sounds better than any razer keyboard out there  I broke a NuPhy air 75 and a Razer black widow v3 just this year by dropping it off my recliner chair  So I bought this one  At least when this one breaks  Im only out 30 dollars instead of 150  But to be honest  This keyboard with the lights mods I did to it is the best keyboard Iv ever used  Big fan  I recommend it All the other keyboards are from China  So why not get the cheaper one that admits it up front,2 stars,2.61,sadness,0.6073119044303894
Not wireless,1 star,5.03,neutral,0.8637869954109192
While searching for a wireless keyboard this cant up as a top result It is an excellent keyboard with a great feel but its definitely not wireless I blame Amazon and their crappy search box Adding more detail to a search makes the results more vague the manufacturer never claimed it was wirelessAnyway good keyboard with long keystrokes and excellent feel like an old IBM Selectric typewriter It has just the right amount of weight to it as wellIt is loud sounds like a keyboard from a movie I cant type full speed in class I have to type gentlyThere are some extra keys that come with it with in different colors as well as a tool for pulling them off They must be for gaming I dont game on PC I just wanted a good fast keyboard for CAD The keys do light up in ONE color that cannot be changed however brightness is easily adjusted after reading the 110 pages manual to find the right function key The keys are individually lit and backlit like a glow between them as well as the face There are several different moving patterns of lighting as well I keep it medium lot and solid Im boringI like it a lot Would love it long time if it were wireless,3 stars,4.79,neutral,0.7705512642860413
